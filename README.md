# sb-beacon-api

SchemaBlocks version of the GA4GH [Beacon API](http://beacon-project.org).

As with other SchemaBlocks projects, this version is a non-authoritive presentation of the work done in the main Beacon project.

However, this version allows fast access to (mostly up-to-date and sometimes previewing) representations of Beacon schema coomponents, for both framework and models.
