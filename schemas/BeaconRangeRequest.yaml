  referenceBases:
    description: |
     Reference bases for this variant (starting from `start`).
     Accepted values: [ACGTN]*. N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of 
     any base, and can be used as a standalone base of any type or within a 
     partially known sequence. For example a sequence where the first and 
     last bases are known, but the middle portion can exhibit countless 
     variations of [ACGT], or the bases are unknown: ANNT the Ns can take 
     take any form of [ACGT], which makes both ACCT and ATGT (or any other 
     combination) viable sequences.
    type: string
    pattern: '^([ACGTN]+)$'
  alternateBases:
    description: |
      The bases that appear instead of the reference bases.   
      * Accepted values: [ACGTN]*. N is a wildcard, that denotes the position 
      of any base, and can be used as a standalone base of any type or within 
      a partially known sequence. For example a sequence where the first and 
      last bases are known, but the middle portion can exhibit countless 
      variations of [ACGT], or the bases are unknown: ANNT the Ns can take any 
      form of [ACGT], which makes both ACCT and ATGT (or any other combination)
      viable sequences.

      Symbolic ALT alleles (DEL, INS, DUP, INV, CNV, DUP:TANDEM, DEL:ME,
      INS:ME) are be represented in `variantType`.

      Either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.
    type: string
    pattern: '^([ACGTN]+)$'
  variantType:
    description: |
      The `variantType` is used to denote e.g. structural variants.

      Examples:
      * DUP: duplication of sequence following `start`; not necessarily in
      situ
      * DEL: deletion of sequence following `start`
      * BND: breakend, i.e. termination of the allele at position
           `start` or in the `startMin` => `startMax` interval, or fusion
           of the sequence to distant partner


      Either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.
    type: string
    examples:
      - 'DUP'
      - 'DEL'
