title: AlternateBases
description: |
  Alternate bases for this variant (starting from `start`).
  * Accepted values: [ACGTN]*.
  * N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any base, and can be
  used as a standalone base of any type or within a partially known
  sequence. As example, a query of `ANNT` the Ns can take take any form of
  [ACGT] and will match `ANNT`, `ACNT`, `ACCT`, `ACGT` ... and so forth.
  * an *empty value* is used in the case of deletions with the maximally
  trimmed, deleted sequence being indicated in `ReferenceBases`
  * Categorical variant queries, e.g. such *not* being represented through
  sequence & position, make use of the `variantType` parameter.
  * either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.
type: string
pattern: ^([ACGTN]*)$
